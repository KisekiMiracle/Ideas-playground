### [[Sylvia Havenglow]]:
**Personality:** Enneagram 3
> *”Threes are self-assured, attractive, and charming. Ambitious, competent, and energetic, they can also be status-conscious and highly driven for advancement. They are diplomatic and poised, but can also be overly concerned with their image and what others think of them. They typically have problems with workaholism and competitiveness. At their Best: self-accepting, authentic, everything they seem to be—**role models who inspire others**.”*

**Gender:** Female
**Attitude:** Cheerful, friendly and easy-going. Reassures others firstmost, then offers assistance—even if there isn’t a clear course of action.

### [[Astarte Cerelia]]:
**Personality:** Enneagram 8
> *”Eights are self-confident, strong, and assertive. Protective, resourceful, straight-talking, and decisive, but can also be ego-centric and domineering. Eights feel they must control their environment, especially people, sometimes becoming confrontational and intimidating. Eights typically have problems with their tempers and with allowing themselves to be vulnerable. _At their Best_: self- mastering, they use their strength to improve others’ lives, becoming heroic, magnanimous, and inspiring.”*
